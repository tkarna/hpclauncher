# Example of a simple run with no dependencies
# ============================================

# Globals
# NOTE define global keywords that can be used in all jobs
sleepTime: 10

# Jobs
# NOTE each job must begin with job_ followed by identifier string
# NOTE job identifier strings can be used as dependency in other runs
job_fast_asleep:       # everything after job_ is jobName
    queue:    normal
    logFileDir: tmp_log_dir
    logFile:  log_simple   # log file given to the queue manager
    nproc:    1
    time:                  # creates timeRequest instance
        hours:   0
        minutes: 2
        seconds: 0
    task_1:                # tasks must have unique names beginning with task_
                           # command is required
        command: 'sleep {sleepTime} && echo "{message}"'
        message: sleeping  # used can define new task specific tags
        logFile: log_task1 # command output redirected here
        redirMode: replace # replace or append
