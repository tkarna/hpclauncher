# Example of a simple run with no dependencies
# ============================================

# Globals
# NOTE define global keywords that can be used in all jobs
sleepTime: 10

# Jobs
# NOTE each job must begin with job_ followed by identifier string
# NOTE job identifier strings can be used as dependency in other runs
job_fast_asleep:       # everything after job_ is jobName
    queue:    normal
    nproc:    1
    time:              # creates timeRequest instance
        hours:   0
        minutes: 2
        seconds: 0
    task_1:            # tasks must have unique names beginning with task_
                       # command is required
        command: 'echo "sleeping" && sleep {sleepTime} && echo "{ending}"'
        ending: done   # used can define task specific tags
